# Honestly it’s like I’m addicted

So, I’ve been through a few blogging formats at this point. 

Here’s my thoughts on all the one’s I’ve tried in short order. 
I’ll put links to ones I favour and you can google the other ones. 

**Wordpress** - easy, reliable, fat bloated security hole ridden garbage.  The McDonalds of blogging platforms.  Yeah you’re everywhere, but you’re scum and you know it.  Loads of WYSIWIG editors and support all over though.  I had like 4 and then felt shame. 

**Ghost** - seemed not bad.  Wordpress lite.  Still used a database to store everything. Wasn’t convinced it was secure. When they updated to v2.0 they made it so it was a pile of hard work to convert it over.  I mean... if I’m going to practically build a new blog.. might as well sniff around.

**[Gatsbyjs](https://gatsbyjs.org/)** - Static site generator sounded sexy. No database for people to hack. Not much chance of security holes. Faster, Stronger, Better.  BUT, I couldn’t get a workflow that worked with Azure. There will be one, I’m clearly just trash.  

**[MiniCore.Blog](https://github.com/madskristensen/Miniblog.Core)** - This is a really nice setup and I was enjoying it and learning some .net core. Unfortunately,  it doesn’t use markdown which meant I was quite limited in options of writing blog posts for it.  For many this won’t be a big deal but for me it was a deal breaker. I may return if I ever get good enough at c# to make it do the stuff I wanted to do.   

**[Jekyll](https://github.com/madskristensen/Miniblog.Core)** - The latest and greatest!, it’s like Gatsby’s dad. It’s a static site generator, meaning I need to figure out how to do some site stuff. I stole a theme from someone much more learned in this area and it’s what you’re reading this on now.  Bonus - there was easy Azure instructions too.  I’ll make a follow up post about how to the same thing once I’ve fine tuned this badboy.
